Quiz App

A simple JavaScript quiz app that displays a series of questions with multiple-choice answers. Users can select an answer, and the app will display whether the answer is correct or not. The app keeps track of the score and displays the final score at the end of the quiz. Users can play again to restart the quiz.

This project demonstrates basic JavaScript, HTML, and CSS concepts such as event listeners, DOM manipulation, and conditional statements. It's a great starting point for beginners looking to build interactive web applications.
